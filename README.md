Here's a concise summary of what you're using for **WalletConnect / wallet integration** so far in your decentralized publishing project:

---

### ✅ **Libraries & Tools**

1. **Wagmi**

   * Main library for handling wallet connections, account state, and interactions with Ethereum.
   * Offers React hooks like `useAccount`, `useConnect`, `useDisconnect`, etc.

2. **viem** (implicitly via Wagmi)

   * Used under the hood for contract interaction and wallet communication.

3. **@tanstack/react-query**

   * Handles async state (caching/fetching) for things like wallet connection status and contract reads.

4. **WalletConnect**

   * Included via Wagmi's `connectors` array for users to connect wallets besides MetaMask.

---

### ✅ **Components You’ve Implemented**

#### `ConnectWallet`

* Decides whether to show wallet connect options or connected account info.
* Uses `useAccount()` from Wagmi.

#### `WalletOptions`

* Maps through available connectors (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.).
* Displays buttons with each connector using a styled `Card` + `Button` UI.

#### `Provider` (Custom Wagmi Wrapper)

* Wraps app in:

  * `WagmiProvider` (for wallet state)
  * `QueryClientProvider` (for react-query)
  * Handles showing `ConnectWallet` and children.

---

### ✅ **Config**

* You have a custom `wagmi` config object (likely with connectors like `injected`, `walletConnect`, etc.).
* Passed to `<WagmiProvider config={config} />`.

---

### ✅ **UI Libraries**

* Using `shadcn/ui` (`Button`, `Card`, etc.) to build a beautiful interface.
* Tailwind CSS + Solarized theme for styling.

---

### ✅ **Routing Auth Control**

* Using Wagmi’s connection state (`isConnected`) to gate access to content.
* No backend auth—just wallet-based session logic (client-side only).

---

Let me know if you want to expand to:

* ENS name resolution
* Session storage for wallet info
* EIP-4361 "Sign-In With Ethereum"
* Network switching or error boundaries

I can also help refactor the connection logic to be more modular or add toast notifications.
